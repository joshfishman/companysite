          <h3>California Chicken Cafe</h3>
        </header>
          <p>When California Chicken Cafe revamped their brand concept, they came to us to create a digital experience that echoed their new identity.</p>
          <p>WE used Wordpress as their content management system for its ease of use and well supported. WE built a custom theme which echoed their brand and is easily maintainable, allowing them to keep their menus and locations up to date as they expanded. </p>
          <p>WE incorporated the Google Maps API to build a branded search experience, allowing users to easily find the closest location and place an order. WE advised on user experience (UX) and site architecture, and performed an accessibility review to ensure that ADA compliance rules were met.
